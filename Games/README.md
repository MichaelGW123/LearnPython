# Games

Collection of games\practice programs written in Python. This was when I was first learning python and getting familiar with it back in summer of 2020.

## Gravity

This is a simple program that simulates gravity. I have versions where gravity is a constant, ones where gravity can be toggled on and off, one's where a fixed constant is applied in a direction.

## Pong

Classic game of pong.

## Snake

Classic game of snake. However, this one was based off of a youtube series and in the series, the food was not aligned to the same grid space that the snake was fixed to, so I modified that myself to appear more like the classic game of snake.

## TicTacToe

Very roughly coded TicTacToe with additional features such as a unique output of the board if you reply that you are a certain player.
