# Machine Learning Repository

This repository contains a collection of basic machine learning projects covering various concepts and techniques. Each part focuses on a specific aspect of machine learning.

## Part 1: Data Preprocessing

In this section, we explore the essential steps involved in preparing data for machine learning models. From handling missing values to scaling features, understanding data preprocessing is crucial for building robust models.

## Part 2: Regression

Learn about regression techniques that help predict numerical values. This section includes examples and code for simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression.

## Part 3: Classification

Delve into classification algorithms, where the goal is to categorize data into predefined classes. Explore popular classifiers such as logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines.

## Part 4: Clustering

Discover the world of unsupervised learning with clustering algorithms. Understand how to group data points based on similarity, including examples of k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.

## Part 5: Association Rule Learning

Explore association rule learning, a technique for discovering interesting relationships within large datasets. Learn about the Apriori algorithm and its applications in finding associations between items.

## Part 6: Reinforcement Learning

Dive into reinforcement learning, an area of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Examples include Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning.

## Part 7: Natural Language Processing

Understand how to process and analyze human language data. Explore techniques such as text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and basic natural language processing tasks.

## Part 8: Deep Learning

Venture into the realm of deep learning, where neural networks with multiple layers can learn complex representations. This section covers basic concepts, architectures, and applications of deep learning.
